We have developed a tool that can be utilized by TikTok users globally. This website allows for a user to upload their video and receive feedback from an AI based off of five main components: video quality, sound quality, accuracy, camera angle, and effort. The AI then would give criticism on the user's performance and give the user tips on how they can improve their moves.
